# 👋 Hi, I’m Shreya Ranjitha  

I’m an **Electronics and Computer Science undergraduate** interested in **RTL design, digital verification, FPGA systems, and semiconductor technologies**. I enjoy working close to the hardware layer — writing **SystemVerilog, building datapaths and control logic, and validating designs through simulation and waveform analysis**.

I currently work as a **Samsung PRISM Intern** and have research experience from **IIT Hyderabad (IASc–INSA–NASI SRFP)**, where I worked on embedded systems, digital design, and FPGA-based platforms.

---

## 🧠 What I Work On
- RTL design & verification (Verilog / SystemVerilog)
- FPGA-based prototyping & simulation
- Digital logic, computer architecture & RISC-V
- Embedded systems & low-level firmware

---

## 🛠️ Projects
🔹 **Neural Network Hardware Accelerator (RISC-V + FPGA)**  
Lightweight NN inference core integrated with a RISC-V processor. Implemented MAC units, memory datapaths, and control logic in SystemVerilog, verified using testbenches and waveform analysis.

🔹 **Neural Network in Verilog (MNIST Classification)**  
Feedforward neural network implemented fully in Verilog with modular design and FPGA-level simulation.

🔹 **FinFET Device Design & Simulation**  
Designed and analyzed FinFET structures using Synopsys and Cadence tools, focusing on leakage, drive current, and scaling behavior.

🔹 **Hand Gesture Recognition Glove (8051 MCU)**  
Embedded wearable system with sensor interfacing, ADC sampling, and UART communication.
